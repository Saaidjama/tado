    At TADO Org. everything we do has just one main goal: the sustained well-being of the underprivileged communities, especially the most vulnerable. Our transformational development approach is holistic instead of focusing on a single issue, we look at all the interconnected areas that affect the well-being of vulnerable segments in the community. For instant, we work with families, donor partners, and communities to address complex challenges, ensuring that children enjoy good health, are educated for life, are cared for, and protected.
    
   <br><br> TADO Organization’s focus is not kept limited either in terms of geography or sector. Whilst operating in different federal member states, TADO organization will be carrying a range of interventions in the areas of education, health & hygiene, youth & women advancement, livelihood development, emergency response & preparedness, good governance, etc. The type of activities undertaken by the organization range from capacity building to service delivery, with the focus remaining on the deprived and marginalized segments of the society. Whereas in terms of operations what characterizes TADO’s functioning is its efforts to (a) enlist the involvement of the locals when initiating activities at the grass-root level; and (b) mobilize the community for bringing peace, tolerance, and development in the society.
